## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

## Developing Data Products

```{r}
options(repos=structure(c(CRAN="https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/")))
# load required package:
install.packages("leaflet")
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
#Load dataset
df <- read.csv("worldcities.csv")

#Set developing data product
df %>% leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lat = df$lat, 
    lng = df$lng, 
    popup = paste(df$popup, "<br>", "City name:", df$city_ascii),
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
